    <description>The project builds a JAR with a single command, being a wrapper around other valid commands, and Spring configuration matching the airline example.

If the JAR resulting from building this project is dropped into target/hot-deploy dir of Airline example (assuming jetty:run was used to start it), it will be detected and the wrapper command configured to intercept requests. 

Results can be observed in the log.</description>
